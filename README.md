# **📌 Multimodal RAG: AI-Powered Speech & Image Processing**
An advanced **Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system** that processes **both speech and images** to generate intelligent responses. This system integrates **Whisper for speech-to-text, Llava for image analysis, and GPT-powered text responses** to enable seamless interaction between audio, visual, and textual data.

---

## **🚀 Features**
- **Speech-to-Text with OpenAI Whisper**: Converts spoken words into accurate text transcripts.  
- **Image Captioning with Llava**: Analyzes images and generates **detailed descriptions** using **Llava-1.5-7B**.  
- **Text-to-Speech Response**: Converts AI-generated text responses into natural-sounding speech using **gTTS**.  
- **Gradio-Powered Interactive UI**: Allows real-time multimodal interactions with speech and images.  
- **Efficient Query Logging**: Captures and stores user interactions for future insights.

## **🛠 Tech Stack**
- **Whisper**: Speech-to-text transcription  
- **Llava-1.5-7B**: Image-to-text model  
- **gTTS**: Text-to-speech conversion  
- **Gradio**: Interactive web-based interface  
- **Transformers & BitsAndBytes**: Model optimization for efficient processing

## **⚡ Quick Start**
### **1️⃣ Install Dependencies**
```bash
pip install -q -U transformers==4.37.2 bitsandbytes==0.41.3 accelerate==0.25.0
pip install -q git+https://github.com/openai/whisper.git
pip install -q gradio gTTS
```

### **2️⃣ Run the Application**
```bash
python multimodal_rag.py
```

## **🎯 How It Works**
### **📌 Step 1: Speech Processing**
- **Whisper** converts voice input into **text**.
- Supports multiple languages and accents.

### **📌 Step 2: Image Analysis**
- Uses **Llava** to **describe objects, colors, and context** of an image.
- Can answer specific queries about an image (e.g., "What color is the microphone?").

### **📌 Step 3: AI-Generated Response**
- The AI **combines speech & image context** to generate intelligent text.
- Converts response to speech using **gTTS**.

## **📊 Example Interactions**
| User Input                          | AI Response |
|--------------------------------------|-------------|
| 🎤 *"Describe this image"*  📸  | **"This is a painting with dominant red and blue hues, featuring..."** |
| 🎤 *"What color is the chair in this image?"* 📸 | **"The chair is predominantly brown with a leather texture."** |
| 🎤 *"What does the text in this image say?"* 📸 | **"The text in the image reads: 'Welcome to AI Conference 2024'."** |
